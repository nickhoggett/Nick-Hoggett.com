About Me

I'm a self taught web developer now looking to take on my first role within the industry. My interest in web design and development was sparked from my previous work experience at Williams Lea while working in IT support and administration when I was given the role to update and manage the content on our department's website. 

From here I have taken it upon myself to learn how to code and now wish to take on a full-time position as a Web Developer. My current 			skills include a confident knowledge of:
				HTML5
				CSS3 
				Javascript / jQuery
				Bootstrap
I'm now looking take these skills into a professional environment and also to continue my progress by continuing to learn the 				back-end languages such as PHP or Python and Ruby. Please take a look at my site linked above and also my code added to GitHub as 			the beginning of a portfolio.
