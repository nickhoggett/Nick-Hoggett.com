	<p>Experimental musician Dan Deacon has teamed up with movie director Theo Anthony for his essay-film <i>Rat Film</i>, a movie based on the rat current rat investation of their home town Baltimore. The music is composed all electronically with the actual movement of rats and fitted the music perfectally </p>
	<h3>49. Nick Hakim - Green Twins</h3>

	<p>Hakim's debut album is a great collection of psychedelic songs taking inspiration from soul singers such as Curtis Mayfield &amp; Marvin Gaye often making all the arrangements very daydreamy followed by the occasional bursts of loud unexpected colour.</p>
